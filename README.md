## Creation Parameters
- **Width / Height -** Width and Height of the maze.
- **Seed -** Directs the creation of the maze. This means that for each combination of parameters + seed you get a specific maze. Just by changing this number, it is possible to create different maze versions  using the same set of parameters.
- **Start / Exit Side -** The side in which you want the start/exit to be on.
- **Maze Type -** You can choose between Partial Braid or Perfect.
  - **Partial Braid:** No dead ends. Such a Maze uses passages that coil around and run back into each other and cause you to spend time going in circles instead of bumping into dead ends.
  - **Perfect:** No loops, closed circuits or inaccessible areas. From each point, there is exactly one path to any other point.
- **Run -** This determines the propensity for the occurrence of long corridors.
- **Density -** Room density.
- **Distance -** Distance between rooms.
- **Min Size -** Minimum size for rooms.
- **Max Size -** Maximum size for rooms.
